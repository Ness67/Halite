"""
Welcome to your first Halite-II bot!

This bot's name is Settler. It's purpose is simple (don't expect it to win complex games :) ):
1. Initialize game
2. If a ship is not docked and there are unowned planets
2.a. Try to Dock in the planet if close enough
2.b If not, go towards the planet

Note: Please do not place print statements here as they are used to communicate with the Halite engine. If you need
to log anything use the logging module.

# Here we define the bot's name as Settler and initialize the game, including communication with the Halite engine.
